Data Science applied to livestock

Dairy farmers monitor their cows at every milking for signs of mastitis or other conditions that could affect the quality of the milk. Working with devices capable of measuring the blood content of milk help to identify it.

By making use of machine learning, we built a prototype algorithm that make a suitable threshold for detection of blood in milk in measurements capture by the device. This prototype also determines where the model meets the ISO guideline for blood in milk detection.
